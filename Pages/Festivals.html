			<i>TRNSMT FESTIVAL, GLASGOW GREEN</i>
			<br><span>Originally TRNSMT Festival was staged as an interim event by the organisers of the world-famous T in the Park, while that was currently being moved to a new location. However, as there was rather surprisingly not a big music festival in such a huge cultural hotspot as Glasgow is, it has now become a yearly event in its own right. For the third year running, there will be three days of great music within the grounds of Glasgow Green.

Headliners Stormzy, Catfish and the Bottlemen and George Ezra will be joined by Snow Patrol, Bastille, Gerry Cinnamon (local favourites), Richard Ashcroft, The Hunna, Circa Waves, Jess Glynne, Tom Grennan, The Amazons and whole lot more.  12TH TO 14TH JULY

			<i>Let It Roll</i>
			<br><span>Let It Roll is pretty much the mothership of drum and bass music. A former military airbase outside of Prague might sound like the perfect place for 4 days and 9 spectacular stages at 170bpm. And that would be because it is.
